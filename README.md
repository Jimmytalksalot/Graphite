**Dependencies**
* Waybar
* Hyprland
* Kitty (Is now Alacrity) 
* Thorium Browser (for some modules)
* swww (for wallpapers)
* Cava (Audio visualizer)
* Pipewire (what I use for audio)
  You may have to change the configuration for cava if you don't use pipewire.

**NOTE**
This is the main repository with my original rice. Make sure to check out the dots branch for the latest dotfiles.


**Install** 
* Place all of the configuration folders into .config. If you already have folders of the same name, create a backup of them or delete them and replace those with these configuration files.
* For the wallpaper to work properly, make sure to use the Hyprland configuration file, mainly initial-boot.sh
